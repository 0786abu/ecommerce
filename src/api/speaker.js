    "description": "Beosound Balance is a wireless speaker with a cutting-edge audio engine, made to deliver a powerful, dynamic yet sophisticated sound experience for larger living spaces. It is designed for design-conscious consumers preferring a display-friendly interior inspired speaker. One that does not have to take up valuable floor space in the home. Placement up against the wall is ideal for optimal listening, whether from room-filling to focused sound modes. Inspired by interior objects and the use of soft and well-curated materials like natural solid oak wood, seamlessly knitted textile and precision-crafted aluminium components, Beosound Balance is the manifestation of the perfect balance between elegant and approachable beauty and unspoiled, pure sound performance.",
